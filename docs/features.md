# Autohand CLI Features

Autohand is an autonomous LLM-powered coding agent designed to work directly in your terminal.

---

## Installation
- [x] npm: `npm install -g autohand-cli`
- [x] Homebrew: `brew install autohand`
- [x] Standalone binaries (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Core Intelligence
- [x] **Autonomous Agent**: ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop for complex coding tasks
- [x] **Multi-Model Support**: OpenRouter integration (Claude, GPT-4, Grok, etc.)
- [x] **Local Providers**: Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX support via `~/.autohand/config.json`
- [x] **Context Awareness**: Automatic project structure analysis

## Interactive Experience
- [x] Slash suggestions (type `/` for commands)
- [x] File mentions (type `@` for file autocomplete)
- [x] **Shell Commands**: Type `!` to run terminal commands without LLM (e.g., `! git status`, `! ls -la`)
- [x] **Smart Paste Detection**: Paste large content (5+ lines) without breaking the prompt
  - Shows compact indicator: `[Text pasted: N lines]`
  - Full content sent to LLM on submit
  - Press Backspace to expand and edit pasted content
  - Works in modern terminals with bracketed paste mode
- [x] Rich terminal UI with status bar, spinners, colored output
- [x] Graceful error handling (ESC cancellation, invalid inputs)
- [x] Progress indicators (spinners)
- [x] Undo for file changes (via undoStack)
- [x] Responsive layout adapting to terminal size
- [x] Theme support (dark/light in config)
- [x] Syntax-highlighted code blocks
- [x] Interactive diff viewer (accept/reject/edit)
- [x] **Plan Mode**: Toggle with Shift+Tab, colorful status indicator, edit tool limiting
- [x] **IDE Integration**: `/ide` command to connect to VS Code, Cursor, Zed, Antigravity
- [ ] Redo for file changes
- [ ] Search history and command palette

## Session Management
- [x] Auto-save to `~/.autohand/sessions`
- [x] Resume with `/resume` or `autohand resume <id>`
- [x] History tracking (interactions, tool outputs, agent thoughts)
- [x] `/history` for paginated session browsing
- [x] Session sharing and export

## Settings Editor

The `/settings` command opens an interactive settings editor directly in the terminal.

- **Two-level category navigation** across 8 categories: UI, Agent, Permissions, Network, Telemetry, Auto-mode, Teams, and Search
- **35 configurable settings** editable without leaving the TUI
- **Auto-save on change** — values are written to `~/.autohand/config.json` immediately
- **Type-aware inputs**: booleans toggle on Enter, enums show a pick list, strings and numbers use inline editing, passwords are masked
- **Smart redirects**: Provider config opens `/model`, theme opens `/theme`, language opens `/language`

## Experiment Switches
- [x] `autohand experiments list` prints a Codex-style table of feature id, lifecycle stage, and enabled state
- [x] `autohand experiments status <feature>` shows one feature, its config path, default, and restart note
- [x] `autohand experiments enable <feature>` and `autohand experiments disable <feature>` persist changes to config
- [x] `autohand experiments refresh` downloads remote feature flags from the Autohand API
- [x] `/experiments` opens an interactive checkbox list for toggling experiments from the TUI
- [x] `/experiments` is the interactive TUI surface for experiment changes
- [x] Remote feature flags are cached in `~/.autohand/feature-flags.json` and refreshed after their API TTL expires
- [x] `cli_usage_v2` is enabled by default and powers `/usage`, `/usage weekly`, and `/usage monthly`

### Experimental: real-time token usage status

The experimental `token_usage_status` switch (default off) replaces the plain
total-tokens counter in the working status line with a live breakdown of tokens
sent up, tokens streamed down, and how full the model's context window is:

```
↑15.7k ↓3.2k · context: 6.0% (15.7k/262.1k)
```

- `↑` is the cumulative input (prompt) tokens sent this session.
- `↓` is the cumulative output (completion) tokens received this session.
- `context: N% (used/total)` shows the most recent request's prompt tokens
  against the active model's context window. The window is resolved per model and
  works across every provider (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Vertex,
  and the rest). When a provider does not report usage the line reads
  `unavailable`; when the window is unknown only the `↑`/`↓` counts are shown.

Enable it with `/experiments enable token_usage_status` (or via the `/experiments`
checkbox list), or set `features.tokenUsageStatus: true` in
`~/.autohand/config.json`. It updates in real time as the model works and takes
effect immediately — no restart required.
