# Agent Skills System

Agent Skills are modular instruction packages that extend Autohand's AI agent with specialized workflows and domain expertise. Skills provide context-aware guidance, tool permissions, and structured approaches for common development tasks.

## Overview

Skills work like on-demand `AGENTS.md` files that can be activated for specific tasks. Each skill contains:

- **Purpose statement** - What the skill does
- **Usage examples** - Concrete prompts showing how to use it
- **Workflow steps** - Actionable procedures for the agent
- **Tool permissions** - Which tools the skill can use

When activated, skills inject their instructions into the agent's context, providing specialized guidance for the task at hand.

---

## Quick Start

### List Available Skills

```bash
# In Autohand REPL
/skills
```

### Use a Skill

```bash
/skills use changelog-generator
```

### Create a New Skill

```bash
/skills new
```

### Auto-Install Recommended Project Skills

```bash
autohand --auto-skill
```

---

## Skill Discovery

Skills are discovered from multiple locations, with later sources taking precedence:

| Location | Source ID | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| `~/.codex/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `codex-user` | User-level Codex skills (recursive) |
| `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `claude-user` | User-level Claude skills (one level) |
| `~/.autohand/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `autohand-user` | User-level Autohand skills (recursive) |
| `<project>/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | `claude-project` | Project-level Claude skills (one level) |
| `<project>/.autohand/skills/**/SKILL.md` | `autohand-project` | Project-level Autohand skills (recursive) |

### Auto-Copy Behavior

Skills discovered from Codex or Claude locations are automatically copied to the corresponding Autohand location:

- `~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.claude/skills/` → `~/.autohand/skills/`
- `<project>/.claude/skills/` → `<project>/.autohand/skills/`

Existing skills in Autohand locations are never overwritten.

---

## SKILL.md Format

Skills use YAML frontmatter followed by markdown content:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: Brief description of the skill (max 1024 chars)
license: MIT
compatibility: Works with Node.js 18+
allowed-tools: read_file write_file run_command git_status
metadata:
  author: your-name
  version: "1.0.0"
---

# My Skill

Detailed instructions for the AI agent...
```

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Required | Max Length | Description |
|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | 64 chars | Lowercase alphanumeric with hyphens only |
| `description` | Yes | 1024 chars | Brief description of when to use this skill |
| `license` | No | - | License identifier (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) |
| `compatibility` | No | 500 chars | Compatibility notes |
| `allowed-tools` | No | - | Space-delimited list of allowed tools |
| `metadata` | No | - | Additional key-value metadata |

---

## Auto-Skill Bootstrap

The `--auto-skill` flag analyzes your project, finds high-confidence community skills that fit the codebase, installs them into `<project>/.autohand/skills/`, and activates them for the session before the agent starts.

### Usage

```bash
autohand --auto-skill
```

### How It Works

1. **Project Analysis** - Scans for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, go.mod
2. **Recommendation** - Uses the skills advisor to rank community skills for the project
3. **Install** - Automatically installs the strongest matches at project scope
4. **Activation** - Activates the installed skills so their instructions are available immediately
5. **Fallback** - If nothing scores highly enough, Autohand continues normally without installing skills

### Detected Patterns

| Category | Detected Items |
|----------|----------------|
| **Languages** | TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Rust, Go |
| **Frameworks** | React, Next.js, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Express, Fastify, NestJS, Flask, Django, FastAPI |
| **Patterns** | CLI tools, testing, monorepo, Docker, CI/CD, bundling, linting, database, API |
| **Package Managers** | npm, yarn, pnpm, bun, pip, cargo, go |
| **Environment** | Git repository, test framework, CI/CD pipelines |

### Example Output

```
$ autohand --auto-skill
Scanning for community skills that fit this project...
Project: Ink TypeScript CLI with strong testing needs.
  ✓ clean-coder-skill (92%) — Improves implementation discipline for CLI refactors.
  Installed clean-coder-skill

Auto-activated skills: clean-coder-skill
```

For manual discovery inside a session, use `/skills install`, `/learn`, `find_agent_skills`, and `install_agent_skill`.

## Creating World-Class Skills

Great skills share these characteristics:

### 1. Clear Purpose

State exactly what the skill does and when to use it.

```markdown
# Changelog Generator

Transforms git commits into polished, user-friendly changelogs for releases.

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing release notes
- Creating weekly update summaries
- Documenting changes for customers
```

### 2. Concrete Examples

Show exact prompts the user can try:

```markdown
## How to Use

```
Create a changelog from commits since v1.2.0
```

```
Generate release notes for the last 2 weeks
```

```
Summarize breaking changes since the last major version
```
```

### 3. Actionable Workflows

Provide numbered steps the agent should follow:

```markdown
## Workflow

1. Identify the commit range (tags, dates, or branch comparison)
2. Fetch commit history with `git_log`
3. Categorize commits by type:
   - **Features**: New functionality
   - **Fixes**: Bug corrections
   - **Breaking**: Incompatible changes
4. Transform technical commit messages into user-friendly language
5. Format as clean markdown with appropriate headers
```

### 4. Platform Awareness

Specify platform-specific commands when relevant:

```markdown
## Platform Commands

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
npm run build && npm test
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
npm run build; npm test
```
```

### 5. Tool Permissions

Specify only the tools your skill needs:

```yaml
allowed-tools: git_log git_diff_range read_file write_file
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Changelog Generator

```markdown
---
name: changelog-generator
description: Creates user-facing changelogs from git commits. Use when preparing releases or documenting updates.
allowed-tools: git_log git_diff_range read_file write_file run_command
---

```

## Tips

- Run from repository root for accurate git access
- Use date ranges for focused changelogs
- Review output before publishing
- Consider your audience (developers vs end-users)
```

### Example 2: TypeScript Refactoring Guide

```markdown
---
name: typescript-refactoring
description: Guides TypeScript refactoring with type-safe patterns and best practices.
allowed-tools: read_file write_file find apply_patch run_command
---

# TypeScript Refactoring Guide

Provides patterns and step-by-step guidance for safe TypeScript refactoring.

## When to Use This Skill

- Extracting reusable functions or components
- Converting JavaScript to TypeScript
- Improving type safety
- Reducing code duplication
- Modernizing legacy patterns

## How to Use

```
Refactor this function to use generics
```

```
Extract the user validation logic into a separate module
```

```
Convert this file to strict TypeScript
```

## Workflow

1. **Analyze Current Code**
   - Read the file(s) to understand existing patterns
   - Identify type issues with `tsc --noEmit`

2. **Plan Changes**
   - List all files that need modification
   - Identify breaking changes to exports
   - Consider backward compatibility

3. **Make Changes**
   - Apply changes incrementally
   - Run type checker after each change
   - Update imports in dependent files

4. **Verify**
   - Run `tsc --noEmit` to check types
   - Run tests to confirm behavior unchanged
   - Review generated diffs

## Common Patterns

### Extract Function
```typescript
// Before
const result = items.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.name);

// After
function getActiveNames<T extends { active: boolean; name: string }>(items: T[]): string[] {
  return items.filter(x => x.active).map(x => x.name);
}
```

### Add Type Guards
```typescript
function isUser(value: unknown): value is User {
  return typeof value === 'object' && value !== null && 'id' in value;
}
```

## Tips

- Enable `strict` mode in tsconfig for best type safety
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when type is truly unknown
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes, types for unions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex types
```
